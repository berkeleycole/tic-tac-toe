# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

Built as a demo for a class project, will continue to add notes and comments to the files. 

Here are the user stories that were created for this project:

Here are the user stories to guide your progress:

- As a user, I should start off seeing a 3x3 grid on the main page

- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to mark it. My partner should be able to
click on a square after me and see their mark.

- As a user, when someone has won the game (3 squares in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) 
or there are no more squares, an alert will tell me who has won or that there are no more squares
and the game has ended.
